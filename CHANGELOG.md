# CHANGELOG

## [2.2.0] - 2025-08-10

### ðŸŽ¯ Path Rewriting Support for Application Deployment

#### Added
- **Path Rewriting in Proxy**
  - Automatic path prefix removal for backend routing
  - Maps `/lacisstack/boards/` â†’ `/` for backend services
  - Preserves original path in X-Original-Path header
  - Intelligent path transformation logic

- **Enhanced HTTP Method Support**
  - Added HEAD, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, PATCH methods
  - Proper HEAD method handling (no body transfer)
  - Full RESTful API compatibility

- **Improved Request Handling**
  - Chunked transfer encoding for large responses
  - Better timeout handling (30 seconds default)
  - Enhanced error logging with detailed messages

- **Additional Proxy Headers**
  - X-Original-Path for debugging
  - X-Real-IP for accurate client tracking
  - X-Forwarded-Proto for protocol awareness

#### Fixed
- **404 Not Found errors for proxied applications**
  - Resolved by implementing path rewriting
  - Applications can now run at root path while accessed via subpaths
  
- **501 Not Implemented for HEAD requests**
  - Added proper HEAD method support
  - Fixed method handling for all HTTP verbs

#### Technical Details
- Path transformation example: `/lacisstack/boards/api/health` â†’ `/api/health`
- Supports applications that expect root-based routing
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing configurations

## [2.1.0] - 2025-08-10

### ðŸ”„ Major Routing Architecture Update

#### Changed
- **BREAKING: Complete nginx configuration overhaul**
  - All traffic now routes through LPG proxy at 127.0.0.1:8443
  - Removed individual service location blocks from nginx
  - Centralized all path-based routing logic within LPG
  - nginx now serves purely as SSL terminator

#### Added
- **Enhanced WebSocket Support**
  - Extended proxy timeouts to 7 days for long-lived connections
  - Disabled proxy buffering for real-time communication
  - Proper WebSocket upgrade header handling

- **Improved Proxy Headers**
  - Added X-Forwarded-Host header
  - Added X-Forwarded-Port header
  - Better client IP tracking with complete header set

#### Fixed
- **502 Bad Gateway errors**
  - Resolved by routing all traffic through LPG
  - Eliminated direct nginx-to-service routing conflicts
  
- **WebSocket connection issues**
  - Fixed with proper upgrade headers and timeout configuration
  
- **SSL cipher compatibility**
  - Updated to modern cipher suite configuration
  - Added TLSv1.3 support

#### Architecture
```
Before: nginx â†’ Individual Services (complex routing)
After:  nginx (SSL) â†’ LPG (all routing) â†’ Services
```

#### Configuration Files Updated
- `nginx/lpg-ssl` - Complete rewrite for centralized routing
- `README.md` - Version bump to 2.1.0

#### Migration Notes
- Update nginx configuration on all deployments
- Restart nginx service after configuration update
- Ensure LPG is running on 127.0.0.1:8443
- All service routing must be configured in LPG, not nginx

- **Hardened Admin Wrapper** - 7-layer defense against 0.0.0.0 binding
  - Pre-launch socket validation
  - Dynamic source code patching
  - Continuous monitoring thread (500ms intervals)
