# CHANGELOG

## [2.1.0] - 2025-08-10

### 🔄 Major Routing Architecture Update

#### Changed
- **BREAKING: Complete nginx configuration overhaul**
  - All traffic now routes through LPG proxy at 127.0.0.1:8443
  - Removed individual service location blocks from nginx
  - Centralized all path-based routing logic within LPG
  - nginx now serves purely as SSL terminator

#### Added
- **Enhanced WebSocket Support**
  - Extended proxy timeouts to 7 days for long-lived connections
  - Disabled proxy buffering for real-time communication
  - Proper WebSocket upgrade header handling

- **Improved Proxy Headers**
  - Added X-Forwarded-Host header
  - Added X-Forwarded-Port header
  - Better client IP tracking with complete header set

#### Fixed
- **502 Bad Gateway errors**
  - Resolved by routing all traffic through LPG
  - Eliminated direct nginx-to-service routing conflicts
  
- **WebSocket connection issues**
  - Fixed with proper upgrade headers and timeout configuration
  
- **SSL cipher compatibility**
  - Updated to modern cipher suite configuration
  - Added TLSv1.3 support

#### Architecture
```
Before: nginx → Individual Services (complex routing)
After:  nginx (SSL) → LPG (all routing) → Services
```

#### Configuration Files Updated
- `nginx/lpg-ssl` - Complete rewrite for centralized routing
- `README.md` - Version bump to 2.1.0

#### Migration Notes
- Update nginx configuration on all deployments
- Restart nginx service after configuration update
- Ensure LPG is running on 127.0.0.1:8443
- All service routing must be configured in LPG, not nginx
