# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

The LPG project is ready to be pushed to GitHub. Follow these steps to create and sync the repository:

## 1. Create Repository on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Create a new repository with these settings:
   - **Owner**: lacis-ai (or your organization)
   - **Repository name**: LPG
   - **Description**: "Lacis Proxy Gateway - Secure reverse proxy with comprehensive safety mechanisms"
   - **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private based on your needs
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

## 2. Push Local Repository

After creating the empty repository on GitHub, run these commands:

```bash
cd /Volumes/crucial_MX500/lacis_project/project/LPG

# Remove old remote and add new one
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/lacis-ai/LPG.git

# Push all branches and tags
git push -u origin main
```

If you're using SSH authentication instead:
```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:lacis-ai/LPG.git
git push -u origin main
```

## 3. Verify Push

After pushing, verify that all files are properly uploaded:
- Check that README.md displays correctly
- Verify the safety warnings are prominent
- Ensure all directories are present (src/, docs/, systemd/, etc.)

## 4. Configure Repository Settings

On GitHub, configure these recommended settings:

### Security
- Enable "Require pull request reviews before merging"
- Enable "Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed"
- Add branch protection rules for `main` branch

### About Section
Add topics:
- `reverse-proxy`
- `python`

### Releases
Consider creating a release tag for the current safe version:
```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0-safe -m "First safe release with network protection"
git push origin v1.0.0-safe
```
