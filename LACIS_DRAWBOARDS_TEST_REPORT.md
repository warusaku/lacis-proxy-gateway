# LacisDrawBoards Application Test Report

**Test Date:** 2025-08-10  
**Test Environment:** macOS Darwin 24.5.0  
**Tester:** Automated Browser Testing with Chromium/Puppeteer

## Executive Summary

The LacisDrawBoards application is experiencing critical issues preventing proper operation. The production URL returns a 502 Bad Gateway error, indicating the backend application server is not responding properly. The local development server is running but has routing issues. WebSocket connectivity could not be established.

## Test Results

### 1. Production URL Testing
**URL:** https://akb001yebraxfqsm9y.dyndns-web.com/lacisstack/boards/

**Status:** FAILED ‚ùå

**Findings:**
- HTTP Status: 502 Bad Gateway
- Server: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu) is running
- SSL Certificate: Valid (Let's Encrypt, expires Nov 6, 2025)
- HTTPS Redirect: Working correctly (HTTP ‚Üí HTTPS)
- Backend Proxy: Not responding (connection to port 8080 failed)
- WebSocket Connections: None detected
- OAuth Integration: Could not be tested due to 502 error

**Error Details:**
```
502 Bad Gateway - nginx cannot connect to upstream server on port 8080
```

### 2. Local Development Server Testing
**URL:** http://localhost:5173/lacisstack/boards/

**Status:** PARTIALLY WORKING ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Findings:**
- Server Status: Running on port 5173
- HTTP Status: 200 OK
- HTML Response: Valid React application HTML
- JavaScript Errors: 404 errors for some resources
- Application loads but has missing dependencies

### 3. Authentication Flow Testing
**Status:** UNABLE TO TEST ‚ùå

**Reason:** Cannot test OAuth authentication flow due to 502 error preventing access to the application.

### 4. WebSocket Connectivity Testing
**Status:** FAILED ‚ùå

**Findings:**
- No WebSocket connections established
- nginx configuration includes WebSocket support but backend is not available
- WebSocket upgrade headers are properly configured in nginx

### 5. LPG Proxy Testing
**Port:** 8080

**Status:** MISCONFIGURED ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Findings:**
- Port 8080 is occupied by a Node.js Express server (not LPG proxy)
- Returns 404 Not Found for root path
- This appears to be a different application than expected
- The LPG Python proxy service is not running

## Critical Issues Identified

### Severity: CRITICAL üî¥
1. **502 Bad Gateway Error**
   - The production URL is completely inaccessible
   - nginx cannot connect to the backend application server
   - Users cannot access the application at all

2. **LPG Proxy Service Not Running**
   - Expected Python-based LPG proxy service is not running
   - Port 8080 is occupied by a different Node.js application
   - This breaks the entire proxy chain

### Severity: HIGH üü†
1. **No WebSocket Connectivity**
   - Real-time collaboration features will not work
   - Drawing synchronization between users impossible

2. **Authentication Flow Blocked**
   - Cannot verify OAuth integration with LacisOAuth
   - Users cannot log in to the application

### Severity: MEDIUM üü°
1. **Local Development Server Issues**
   - 404 errors for some resources
   - Development environment not fully functional

## Root Cause Analysis

The primary issue is that the LPG proxy service (Python-based) is not running on the expected port 8080. Instead, a Node.js Express server is occupying this port, which is not configured to handle the LacisDrawBoards routing. This causes:

1. nginx to receive connection but get 404 responses
2. The 502 error when nginx tries to proxy to the non-existent backend
3. Complete application unavailability

## Recommendations for Fix

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Stop the incorrect Node.js service on port 8080:**
   ```bash
   # Find and kill the Node.js process
   kill -9 69680  # PID from the test
   ```

2. **Start the LPG proxy service:**
   ```bash
   cd /Volumes/crucial_MX500/lacis_project/project/LPG/src
   python3 lpg-proxy.py
   ```

3. **Verify LPG admin service is running:**
   ```bash
   python3 lpg_admin.py
   ```

4. **Check systemd services (if on Linux):**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status lpg-proxy
   sudo systemctl status lpg-admin
   ```

### Configuration Verification:

1. **Check nginx configuration is correctly loaded:**
   - Verify `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/` has the correct symlink
   - Test nginx configuration: `nginx -t`
   - Reload nginx: `nginx -s reload`

2. **Verify proxy routing in LPG:**
   - Check `devices.json` for correct routing rules
   - Ensure LacisDrawBoards backend is properly configured

3. **Test WebSocket connectivity after services are running**

## Testing Commands for Verification

After implementing fixes, run these commands to verify:

```bash
# Test LPG proxy
curl -I http://localhost:8080

# Test LPG admin
curl -I http://localhost:8443

# Test production URL
curl -I https://akb001yebraxfqsm9y.dyndns-web.com/lacisstack/boards/

# Check WebSocket upgrade
curl -H "Connection: Upgrade" -H "Upgrade: websocket" \
     https://akb001yebraxfqsm9y.dyndns-web.com/lacisstack/boards/ws
```

## Conclusion

The LacisDrawBoards application infrastructure is properly configured (nginx, SSL, routing) but the critical backend services (LPG proxy) are not running. Once the correct services are started on the expected ports, the application should become accessible and functional.

**Current State:** Application is completely unavailable to users  
**Required State:** All backend services running and properly proxied through nginx  
**Estimated Fix Time:** 15-30 minutes once services are properly started
